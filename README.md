### Installation

Should compile without any problems - the only thing to keep in mind it's the OS:
The project was developed on MAC so only change the SDK path if you want to run it on WINDOWS.

```sh
WINDOWS (default Windows location, or your location if moved)
sdk.dir="C:\Users\<username>\appdata\local\android\sdk"
MAC *current*
sdk.dir=/Users/<username>/Library/Android/sdk
```
